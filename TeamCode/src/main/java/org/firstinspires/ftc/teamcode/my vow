i vow
to bring a little light into the world,
to honor those who came before me, and cracked up the sky,
who opened up a path for stars to shine,
a path which i promise to embrace, to widen up even more
to let light shine unto the dark
to let the future take a peek trough
to let dreams soar along the winds of fate

i swear
to never repeat the mistakes of my predecessors,
but to learn and forge anew the past,
to burn away the shadows, along with the old me,
and cast light unto rebirth and respite

like fireflies to a flame, life begets death, but so death begets life, and dark begets light
i will set the seas ablaze, and i will become a guiding flame to those who come after me,
a northern star across the night sky
a red shine upon a black field
